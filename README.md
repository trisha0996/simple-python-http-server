# Simple Python HTTP Server
Create the most basic http web server in Python.

An HTTP web server is a process that runs on your machine and does exactly two things:

1. Listens for incoming http requests on a specific TCP socket address (IP address and a port number)

2. Handles this request and sends a response back to the user.
